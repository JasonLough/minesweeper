# minesweeper
minesweeper clone in pure javascript (ES6)

In theory, you should be able to just

npm install

then

npm start

after cloning this repo. It uses webpack and webpack dev server, so you should be able to alter it, save, and immediately see the results.

This is missing a few functionalities, such as expanding the zone where no mines are detected, and a game over screen. Also, open your console up to see more about where you clicked.

I tried to make this as uncomplicated as possible, but theres parts that could be better. For example, the summing of the total mines a tile is touching part.
